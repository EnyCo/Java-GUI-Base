# Base-GUI
made by Enay Bhatnagar on 10/10/2024



STYLE:
    - end all commented out (or not!) debug code with "debug" or "ERROR"
    - Screens hold arraylist<arraylist<GUIcomponent>>
        - first list will be images 
        - second list will be buttons
        - third list will be text boxes

    - every component is located by center point.
        

TESTING:
    - confirm Button Exit Yes and Exit No work for each new screen

TODO:
    - put new audios into struct
    - mouse click not actually checking for once? (maybe a issue with multithreading)
    - make audio tied to guiComponents?
