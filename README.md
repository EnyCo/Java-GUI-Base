# Base-GUI
made by Enay Bhatnagar on 10/10/2024



STYLE:
    - end all commented out (or not!) debug code with "debug" or "ERROR"
    - Screens hold arraylist<arraylist<GUIcomponent>>
        - first list will be images 
        - second list will be buttons
        - third list will be text boxes

    - every component is located by center point.
        

TESTING:
    - confirm Button Exit Yes and Exit No work for each new screen

ERRORS:
    - clicking an answer choice currently keeps giving you points even after its been clicked

TODO:
    - put new audios into struct
    - make audio tied to guiComponents?
    - make in terms of interfaces?
